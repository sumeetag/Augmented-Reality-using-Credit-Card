# Augmented-Reality-using-Credit-Card
Extracting card number and then displaying user account details along with online payments features. Displaying nearby Bank/ATMS using geo-tracking of Wikitude Software.

The idea of making a smart card using augmented reality won my team a place in the final round of the ICICI Trinity Contest. As per our proposal the application will scan the debit or credit card of the user and display the bank details such as account balance, last few transactions and the expenditure summary in an exhaustive manner.
